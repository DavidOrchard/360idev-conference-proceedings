<li>Chuck Smith Intro to Itunes connect so so but a couple good points: Follow Apple docs, not web site.  Follow the document at the bottom.  Description for example submission says 700 words, but actually 4000
<li>Chris Hughes did his awesome <a href="http://spazout.com/360_idev_post_talk_mega_pack">jailbreaking</a>, here's <a href="#chrishughes">my notes</a>.  He blogged about how <a href="http://spazout.com/google_cheats_independent_iphone_developers_screwed">Google uses proximityStateChanged</a> and a demo of how we can too.
<li>Jay Freeman had no notes on cydia jailbreak store, here's <a href="#saurik">my notes</a>
<li>Persistence for mere mortals liked SQLitePersistentObjects a lot, and also mentioned <a href="http://github.com/mocra/fmdb-migration-manager/tree/master">fmdb migration manager</a>

My totally rough notes:
<pre>
Mike Lee:
Loves doing nil chaining, send a nil to a nil it returns nil.  No constant check blocks.
Method Swizzling: messages instead of functions, level of indirection.  Objective C treats methods as objects.  Can swap out methods for another.  Great for debugging.  Found a bug in one of apples controller objects.  Swapped in their own impl and showed it to Apple for submitting bug.  Set breakpoints inside impl of framework by subclassing then swizzle.  
Thinks $2.99 is a good price.  Another idea is to do a free and then do a different one and market to the free saying check out our new app.
Figure out how to get $10K.  Hard to get 5000 people to buy for $2.99, could be harder to get 15000 people to buy for $.99
Mobclicks, competes with adMob, analytics touted.  

Owen Goss: Creation of an iPhone game (dapple) Provides 
-----------------
IndieGamer forums for contract help
Loading system: Each mode loads it's own resources, textures, etc.  minimal footprint when not in game mode.
     easier to track memory leaks.  Couldn't animate in the middle of the screens
Configure: Custom openGL UI framework.  Very slick looking Options: sliders, tick boxes, fonts, button
  Always take longer than you think.
Save game system: The act of saving the users game makes them feel like the game belongs to them.
Sound: SoundEngine had lots of bugs, his fixes are on Dev Forums as OTrain13.  Lots and lots of crashes.  Use AVAudio player
       Handles playing iPod music during the game.

Rendering: uses two different blending modes, some problem with alpha?

Fonts: get licensing early

Weekly: play, bug fixes, memory leak tests, perf tests.

Testing lessons learned:
Build Number, and make sure testers use build #
Symbol files.  Keep these for each build.  These are the DSYM files. 
Crash logs.  
symbolicatecrash is a big one.  Use Asserts.

Tips for marketing
---------
Ask for Enhanced page like Freeverse, or x-plane
If somebody asks for review, have material ready.
You can update icon, ie (new), or price

App review sites, well known blogs, specialist blogs
Targeted Users: testimonials, word of mouth, trade publications, trade sites
Apple is going back to not allowing posts without purchase
Couple hundred bucks to hire thousand devs to review sites.
Advertise your app: MediaLets, Admob, greystripe
unlock features, like wallpaper
with your peers/frenemies, cross promotions.

Subscriptions: Can allow subscriptions if you paid on the web site, ie real time stock quotes
Apple does not like you taking away 30%.  Don't change that value.  If your profile existed before that day, then the app can extend.  
Data delivered from a web service can be subscription based, but not data on the phone.  
If I'm purchasing credits outside the app, and spending credits inside the app, that's ok.
Credit card payment is now totally allowed, do the merch app right in the phone through the app not the web
Can do a limited version of a feature, ie get 2 movie reviews and have to pay to get more.

App sniper checks price trending 
EA apps are $10, card games are $2.99
Rolando, $9, $7, $5
Pricing: MLB did at Bat 2008.  Promote AtBat 2009.  Then turn at bat 2008 to free at bat lite

Underserved market: Women, Hispanic/Latino, Children

PinchMedia
---------
Paid vs free.  
#1 # of times user will run a free app
 on average, a free app runs a max of 10 runs

#2 how many more user will a free app
for total uniques 7.5 to 1
total # of imes: 6.6 to 1
total time spent, 3.9 to 1

#3 call it 12 times, then * 7.5 times for total uniques = 90 sessions/user
Instead of 1 paid sale for $.7 the developer has 90 sessions.
To earn $.7 in 90 sessions, you need $7.78 per thousand runs??  
If you show 1 ad pers session, thats $7.78 CPM
Very difficult
ideal strategy, install analytics, understand your audience.

Some apps benefit from network affects, get more than 7.5x
Some apps are very sticky

Top 10% decile does total 40 runs
CPM wise:
Top 10% is CPM <$2.
then $7, down to $35 CPM
Unless there's something inherent about the app that screans free, start by selling it
Only release an ad-supported version when you have data strongly indicating success.

Jailbreaking and nu
-----------
Nu is a new language, nush (nu shell), nuke (nu make)
"pwning" disables signature checks in the iPhone bootloader
a custom "IPSW" iphone software image disables kernal restrictions on user processes.
code for pwning on github
Cydia and installer are the new apps on the iphone after jailbreaking.  These apps are installed in a different place and won't
about 25% of audience had jailbroken phones
out of the box every iPhone's root password is 'alpine", change
fav apps open ssh locate, 

ssh -l root

Turn off activate the phone with a regular phone connected 
baseband is gsm radio
Choose default mem size

THE installer often not (ripdev guys, all russians)

Two recovery modes DFU, Regular

fmdb thin wrapper around sqlit
fmdb-migration-manager - Rails-style migrations using fmdb

Aptiva's Active recrod
github.com/aptiva/activerecord

to update sqllite db
sqlite3 groceries.db
sqlite>.schema

Have to copy database from a bundle into /documents directory because bundle is signed so read only

sample code
loadData{ if (sqlite3_open([path UTFI8String], &db) == SQLITE_OK)

const char * sql = "SELECT pk, title, position FROM quick_list ORDER BY position";
if (sqlite3_prepare_v2(db, sql, -1, &find_all_statement, NULL) != SQLITE_OK ){
NSAssert1(0, @"Failed to prepare");
pk = sqlite3_column_int(find_all_statement, 0);

fmdb looks a lot easier

Can look at db by Applications Path Finder
Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/User/Applications/..
void) migrate
{
   NS

CreateGrocerList
(void) up {
	[self createTable:@"groceries" withColumns:[NSArray arrayWithObjects: 
	[FmdbMigrationColumn column withColumnName:@"id" columnType:@"INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENTA"];
>>>> Interesting points
Primary KEY always called id in the database
Can't call a property "id", so he uses pk
<<<<<<

Danton Chin maximizing memory
---------------------
copy, alloc, retain ref count + 1

release
autorelease, ref count -1 at some point in the future

form +className are not own by you

be lazy about allocating, but not lazy about releasing, use release instead of autorelease
can create autorelease pool, stacked
new are added to top, auto released objects add to the top auto release pool
drained/dealoced pools are removed from the stack

What tools can we use?
Instruments and Shark
Clang Static Analyzer
DTrace, new 
Create Custom Trace Document/Template:
Activity Monitor

clang
scanbuild command 
-k keep going if it fails
-v, -v -v, -v -v -v
